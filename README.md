# Todo List + UI Tests

Chance to play around with React, Redux, Material-UI, and Cypress. Used [this tutorial](https://redux.js.org/docs/basics/ExampleTodoList.html) as a starting point. Updated with the following
- used [Material-UI](http://www.material-ui.com/) to improve look
- consolidates some components for easier readability
- adding UI tests using [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) - this is such a step up from Selenium

### UI Tests
To run Cypress, first run the app `npm start`; then open Cypress via `npm run cypress:open`. In the Cypress application, run the tests by clicking on `todo_spec.js`.
